// My role in the group is: Translate tests into user stories (Person 1)

// Here is my part of the challenge:

//Function name: sum
//I want a program that accepts a list of numbers, calculates the total and gives me the total.

//Function name: mean
//I want a program that accepts a list of numbers, calculates the average and gives me the average. 

//Function name: median
//I want a program that accepts a list of numbers and finds the median number. 
//If the length of the list is an even number, the median should be the average of the two middle numbers.

//Reflection:

// What was this experience like?

// The experience was a little nerve-wracking at first because I wasn't sure of how much detail 
// to include in the user stories. I was able to ask Maria for some guidance, which helped me get
// started with the challenge. I also spoke with Jeff to make sure the user stories were clear
// and that helped alleviate some anxiety I had. I really enjoyed seeing the final code and felt
// relieved that we were able to pass all the tests. 

// Was your group successful in passing the tests?

// Yes! 

// What did you learn about writing user stories, pseudocoding, writing code, refactoring, etc.?

// I realized that user stories are essential to the process since the information in the user stories 
// guides every following step. I felt a lot of pressure at first but it was a great learning experience. 

// Prior to writing the user stories, I actually tried writing the final code and that helped me 
// figure out what details I would need to include in the user stories. It helped me understand why it's
// important as a developer to understand what the user is trying to do with the program you are
// building. 

// I feel that I better understand the process of writing user stories, but I'm still not very
// familiar with writing pseudocode. I'm hoping I'll get more practice with that in future 
// challenges. 

// I really enjoyed the whole process and it was comforting to know that we were able to complete
// the project successfully despite my concerns as Person 1 at the beginning of the challenge.
