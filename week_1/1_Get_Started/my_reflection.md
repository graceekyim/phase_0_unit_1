## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

  I found that setting up git and GitHub was relatively easy. It wasn't until I tried using git that I ran into some confusion. When I started running git commands in the terminal, I was under the impression that it was the same thing as using GitHub, but after reading the articles I realized they were actually very different.

  Git is a "version-control software" that allows you to save snapshots of projects, such as essays, spreadsheets and mostly importantly, code! These snapshots can be taken at any time while you are working on the project and can later be referenced to see what the project looked like at that particular time. This provides a security blanket of sorts that the user can fall back on. For example, if you realize that you made a huge error two snapshots ago, you can go back three snapshots to find a version of your project before the error was made. One important thing to remember about git is that it is saved locally on your computer. 
  GitHub is similar to git in that it allows a user to save snapshots of projects, but there is one very important difference -- it lives on the internet. This means that these snapshots can be accessed anywhere and it allows multiple users to access the same project. This is especially helpful for developers because GitHub allows users to work on the same code simultaneously.

  Version control tracks the changes that a user makes to a project and saves snapshots of the project that can be referenced later. GitHub provides version control and then stores this information on the internet so it can be accessed anywhere and by anyone. This is helpful for projects where multiple users need to access the same project.

  Developers use version control since it provides a history of their code and all the changes that have been made. This is especially helpful when they run into errors and need to restore older, cleaner versions of the code. This is also helpful when they want to test different types of code since they can switch between new and old versions of the code. I believe it definitely makes sense to use version control while writing code. 

  Using version control makes sense for all developers, old and new. By saving snapshots of your code, you can review your own work and allow others to see what decisions you made to develop your code. This is especially helpful for people who need to give you feedback on the code you wrote.
