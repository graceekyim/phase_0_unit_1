## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

  First, you will need to log onto the GitHub website and click on the link that says “new repository.” Repositories are basically folders where you can save projects you are working on. These folders can be accessed from the internet and by anyone you give access to. You will need to give your repository (folder) a name that contains your username, using the following format: [USERNAME].github.io. On that same page, make sure to click the button next to “Public” and check the box next to “Initialize this repository with a README.” Then, click on the dropdown menu titled “Add a license” and select “MIT License.” Click “Create repository.” The folder has been created! 
  In order to allow your computer to access the repository directly, you will need to “clone” it on your computer. In order to do this, open and log in to your GitHub App on your computer. Select your username on the left side of the window and in the search bar at the top, start typing “github.” You should then see the name of the repository you created. Click “Clone to this computer.” Congratulations! You’ve created and cloned a repository!

  Open source means that the source code of a program is available to the public so that anyone can access it. This allows people to see how the program was built and allows them to copy it and change it for their needs. This also allows people to improve it and suggest changes to the author of the program. 

  The concept of open source simultaneously scares me and gives me hope. I know that in order to become a good developer, I need feedback and suggestions from fellow developers. Open source would allow me to distribute my code to a wider audience to get helpful feedback. On the flip side, open source scares me because I would be anxious to have so many people critique my work. 

  It seems like licenses are necessary in order to maintain a balance in the open source community. For example, if someone used an open source program to create a better program and didn’t allow anyone else to see this better program, it would seem unfair to benefit from another person’s work without sharing your own. There should be some reciprocity in order to make open source beneficial for everyone and it seems like licenses endorse that.  

  I am better able to understand how GitHub works now that I’ve created and cloned a repository. It’s also comforting to know that I can access the GitHub App on my computer at any time. 
  As for open source, I have always wondered how it works and what securities are in place to make it mutually beneficial for all developers. It’s encouraging to know that there are various licenses available to protect open source programs. 

  I found that all the resources provided by DBC were sufficient to help me understand the topics in this challenge.
