It took me some time to understand the relationship between CSS and HTML. I was initially under the impression that HTML and CSS were created together and that HTML could not manipulate any text without being linked to a CSS file. Surprisingly, when I created an HTML file I found that I could see different font sizes (headers), text emphasis and links. After doing some research, I learned that CSS was built several years after HTML was created in order to provide web designers the ability to change how their page looks. This helped me better understand the relationship between CSS and HTML. 

I think it's great that when you write HTML, you can focus on creating the structure of the page without having to worry about the style. This allows you to focus on one aspect of the webpage at a time. Then, when you are done completing the structure, you can focus on building the style based on the existing HTML. As for "bad" things about HTML, it seems like making changes in the file would be time-consuming. For example, if you needed to change a specific word in the text, you would need to find and replace every instance of that word. Meanwhile in programming, you could set a variable that could be referenced multiple times in the code. I suppose there may be an equivalent of a "variable" in HTML, but I currently don't know of one. 

I feel that I now better understand the connection between CSS and HTML and how CSS vastly improves the presentation of HTML. I also understand why CSS is called a "cascading" style sheet. 

I found the following helpful site when I ran a Google search on the history of CSS: http://www.w3.org/Style/LieBos2e/history/Overview.html. It helped explain why and how CSS was created.
