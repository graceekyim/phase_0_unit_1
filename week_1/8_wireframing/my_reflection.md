I learned that the design experience is much more complicated than I had initially thought and there are many people who have to be involved in the planning in order to make sure the final product is well received. It is especially helpful to do research and get feedback to design the best user experience. 

I enjoyed creating the wireframes. When I was building my blog template, I was basically creating wireframes in my head and it was helpful to actually draw it out this time. 

Most of my questions were regarding the process of drawing wireframes and I was able to reference the Tuts+ page. 

I'm still learning how to best layout a page when there are images and text. I want to make sure my pages are easy to read and not too plain. I think this will get easier with time as I get more familiar with using CSS. 

I learned how to add borders to images and how to create wireframes.

I'm pretty confident with wireframing and user experience design. I'm excited to see what the design experience will be like when we work in teams. 

I enjoyed drawing the wireframes and seeing how and why the designer made the choices they did. It also helped me to see what design choices I agreed or disagreed with. 

Reading about the user experience design process was a little tedious. It seems like the process will differ based on the people you work with and the work environment you are in. Consequently, the best approach may be to create a user experience design process unique to your company/team.
