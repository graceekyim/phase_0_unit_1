I had a couple questions regarding positioning and how to use ids and classes to position sections of the HTML. Specifically, I was interested in how to use them to position a paragraph. I found the answers I needed in a book titled “HTML & CSS: Design and Build Websites.” This book has been especially helpful during this first week of Phase 0 while I’ve been learning HTML and CSS. 

Initially I was having trouble deciding which positioning scheme to use, but after testing the various options I was able to determine the best one. For example, with the picture caption, I ended up using absolute positioning. 

I learned how to use float to place the header and sidebar side-by-side. I also learned how to add padding, margins and borders to clearly mark the different containing elements. 

I’m confident with most of the competencies, but I think I could use more time studying positioning. Since I learn best by experimentation, I’ll spend some time trying out the different positioning options.

I enjoyed testing out the various layouts and determining the best way to position each containing element. It was very encouraging to see the final product after applying all the lessons that I’ve learned. 

Adding the borders, padding and margin was tedious at times. This was especially true when I was applying the same borders, padding and margin to multiple divs.
