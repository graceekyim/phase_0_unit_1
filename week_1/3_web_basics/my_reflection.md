## 3. [Web Basics](3_web_basics/readme.md) Reflection

* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?
* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I learned the difference between websites and web applications. While I had heard both terms in the past, it wasn't until now that I understood that websites are generally static while web applications are dynamic. I now understand that HTML and CSS (and maybe Javascript) are used to build websites while programming languages must be used to create web applications. I also learned that IP addresses and domain names can be used interchangeably and that they will point to the same web page. 

When setting up your HTML site, you must remember to register a domain name, find a host for the site, specify name servers and point the domain name to the IP address. While all of these steps are necessary to set up a web page, it is especially important to link the domain name to the IP address since web servers cannot return the web page if they don't know the IP address for the domain that is entered. 

At first, I was anxious because I received an error message when I tried to view my web page. The message stated that it may take up to 10 minutes to view a page, so I waited several minutes. Meanwhile, I checked my HTML code to make sure it was correct. Fortunately, when I tried to load the page again, it finally appeared and I was relieved.

I definitely had an "aha" moment when I learned the difference between websites and web applications. I now know that programming languages are needed to create web applications, which are more dynamic. This also explains why programming languages are more complex than HTML.

Nope.
