Hi everyone,

I'm excited to get to know all of you these next couple weeks as we prepare for Phase 1. Here's some info about me:

I've been living in Chicago for the past seven years and decided to attend DBC after taking an intro to computer programming course last year. The first week of Phase 0 has been surprisingly intense, but I think I have a better idea of what to expect now that we're finishing up our first week. 

I'm free to pair most weeknights after 5pm and on the weekends in the afternoon, so let me know what times work for you guys. 

Happy coding!

Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 

It was comforting to hear that other people have the same fears and anxieties about DBC. My biggest fear is that I'll be the weakest link and I want to make sure I keep up with all the Phase 0 work so I'm well prepared for Phase 1. 

The workload was surprisingly intense this week, but I think I now have a better idea of how much time I need to set aside for Phase 0. I feel much more comfortable now than I did earlier in the week. The intro Google hangout also helped a lot since I was able to hear from other students and get an idea of how much programming experience other people had.
