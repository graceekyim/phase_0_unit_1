# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?

I think web standards are good since they provide developers with established guidelines. This helps developers understand each other's code and also helps ensure that different web browsers understand the code. 

* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?

Yes. It seems like the standard structure is relatively easy to understand, especially with the new HTML5 elements.

* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?

Yes. I think this helps simplify the use of <div> and allows you to better visualize the structure of an HTML document. 

* Why is reset.css necessary? 

Since web browsers (Chrome, IE, Firefox, etc.) have unique display defaults, you will commonly notice that sites look different in different browsers. The reset.css file solves this problem by ensuring that your webpages are starting from the same display defaults before executing your CSS file. 

* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?

I've used Chrome, IE and Firefox and noticed some website compatibility issues with Chrome. I think it's very inconvenient that some sites are built to work with specific browsers and not others. It seems like developers should account for all browsers when building apps and sites. 

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I found Eric Meyer's site particularly helpful in explaining the need for reset.css files: http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/.
