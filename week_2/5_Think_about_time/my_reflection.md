# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 

I've had two time management challenges since starting Phase 0. 

1. The first challenge has been finding enough time to study and complete the assignments. Week 1 took more hours than I had expected, so I was scrambling to finish the challenges in time.

2. The second challenge has been setting a time limit. Occasionally, I've started working on challenges and lost track of time. I stay up too late and I'm exhausted at work the next day.

* How will you combat that? 

Now that we're finishing up Week 2, I think I have a better idea of how many hours I need to finish the challenges. I'd like to set aside specific days to study and set a cutoff time when I need to stop for the day. This will teach me to maximize the time I have and get enough rest.

* What techniques will you try?

I plan on trying the Pomodoro Technique. I like that the technique sets a 25-min limit, allows for short breaks and teaches you how to manage distractions. I think this could help me get the most out of the hours I set aside for studying.

I'd also like to try using the Fogg Method to develop new, small habits. Since starting Phase 0, I haven’t had a chance to review Ruby and I’d like to make time to do that. I believe the Fogg Method will help me start with a small habit, like doing one Ruby exercise per day. 

* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

My plan is to set aside specific days and hours for studying and completing challenges. I'll try different techniques for managing projects to determine what works best so I can develop good study habits before getting to Phase 1. I also want to set aside time to review what I've learned and to go more in-depth. This will help me retain the information I've learned so far.
