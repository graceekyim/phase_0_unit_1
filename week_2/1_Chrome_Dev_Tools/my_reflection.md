# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?

The DOM is a programming interface that allows you to manipulate webpages and make them dynamic. For example, DOM allows you to connect JS to a webpage. DOM does this by defining the structure of the HTML document, including objects and nodes, and defining the relationship between elements (parents and children). This then allows for the webpage to be connected to scripts or programming languages. 

Knowing that DOM can change the style of a website, I'm curious to know how that affects the CSS file that's linked to the same HTML document. Are there any conflicts or errors that arise because JS and CSS are changing the style of the same HTML page?

* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?

The first thing I noticed about the wordpress.com site was that it had a significant number of JS files. It seems like the JS files were being used to connect the page to information from Gravatar, twitter and vimeo.  Compared to the wordpress.com site, my GitHub site was much simpler. There were significantly fewer JS files and all the links were referencing files that were already within GitHub. 

* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?

The tools were helpful but it was confusing at times since I didn't understand all the code or terms that were being used. I can see how it would be useful to developers, especially when it comes to improving the website's performance and debugging scripts. As time goes on and I become familiar with scripts and debugging, I think I will appreciate the tools more. 

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?

I recently had a discussion with my coworker about image sizes and how resolution can affect the loading time for a webpage. Seeing the "Network" tab under Dev Tools helped me understand why image size is so important in a webpage. 

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I found the skillcrush site the most helpful in understanding the basic idea behind DOM.
