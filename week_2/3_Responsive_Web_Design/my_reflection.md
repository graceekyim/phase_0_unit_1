# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?

 Responsive web design is the practice of designing websites that adapt to different devices, resolutions and screen sizes. Instead of creating multiple versions of the same site (like mobile-versions), responsive web design allows you to use the same version for all devices. I think this is a great practice since so many users are now accessing sites with smartphones and tablets in addition to computers. 

* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?

I believe smartphones and tablets have changed web design in that the smaller screens are forcing web designers to be more efficient with limited space. In addition, I think users now expect websites to be as accessible and user-friendly on smartphones as they are on computers. As technology improves with time, I think that tablets will become just as commonplace as computers, making responsive web design essential to building websites. 

* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?

I would guess that many visually impaired people rely on screen-readers to use the web, while some may be able to read websites if the font is adjusted for their needs (brighter colors, larger font sizes, etc.). I think we should definitely design and develop for them. 

* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?

Responsive web design has definitely resonated with me. On more than one occassion, I've been directed to mobile versions of a website on my iPhone and found it to be inadequate. I usually end up going to the web-version of the site, which is not responsive. Responsive web design seems like a great way to adapt for smaller devices without sacrificing good design. 

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I found this website to be helpful in understanding how to change font sizes in responsive web design: http://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-responsive-web-design-how-to-manage-fonts/.
