# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: http://graceekyim.github.io/

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 

I discovered that the design process takes a lot of deliberate research and planning. First, I visited various websites to determine what design aesthetics and layouts I liked. Then I took some time to consider what layouts would work best for the content. Lastly, I had to think about the user experience and whether my site would be easy to navigate.

* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

Yes, I really enjoyed the design process and creating the wireframe. It was helpful to research other websites to see what was possible and it felt great to have the knowledge to create a site from scratch. 

* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?

I started off by looking at various blogs and websites to see what kinds of designs I liked. I generally tend to appreciate simple designs, so I created a wireframe that was easy to read and navigate. The hardest part was implementing the design and figuring out how to position the sidebar and images. 

* What would you like to add or change about the site next?

I think I'll experiment with more color in the next design phase. While I prefer simple designs, my current website is a little too safe. I also think that I should experiment more with adding content to the sidebar. 

* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?

It was difficult to figure out the float property. I had to add borders to my blocks to see how my CSS changes were being applied. I think I have a better grasp of it now, but I'm planning on spending more time experimenting with it. 

I think that media queries in responsive web design is a great idea. I didn't get an opportunity to incorporate that into my website, but I would be interested in researching it more. 

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
